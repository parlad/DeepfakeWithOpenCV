## About

**DeepfakeWithOpenCV** is an open-source project that leverages OpenCV and deep learning techniques to create realistic deepfake videos and images. This project aims to provide an accessible way for developers and researchers to experiment with deepfake technology, understand its mechanics, and explore its applications and implications.

## Features

- Face detection and alignment using OpenCV.
- Deep learning-based face swapping.
- Support for video and image inputs.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Extensible architecture for custom models.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip
- Git

### Steps

```bash

### Additional Enhancements with Markdown

To further enhance your README, you can incorporate badges, images, and other Markdown features. Here's how you can do it:

#### Adding Badges

Badges provide quick insights into your project's status. You can add badges for build status, license, contributors, etc. For example:

```markdown
![Build Status](https://github.com/parlad/DeepfakeWithOpenCV/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Examples

### Swap Faces in an Image

![Face Swap Example](images/face_swap_example.jpg)

```bash
python deepfake.py --source images/person1.jpg --target images/person2.jpg --output output/swapped_person.jpg
